h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Composer)! Rails Composer

An application template that creates starter applications for Rails 4.1.

It's the Rails generator on steroids.

The Rails Composer application template is built from recipes provided by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. Need to customize the Rails Composer application template? Want to build your own application template? Use the  "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/join/join-railsapps.png(Join RailsApps)!:http://railsapps.github.io/

h4. From the RailsApps Project

The "RailsApps project":http://railsapps.github.io/ provides example applications that developers use as starter apps. Hundreds of developers use the apps, report problems as they arise, and propose solutions. Rails changes frequently; each application is known to work and serves as your personal "reference implementation."

Support for the project comes from subscribers. If you use Rails Composer, please "join RailsApps":http://railsapps.github.io/ and support the project.

h4. If You Are New to Rails

If you're new to Rails, see "What is Ruby on Rails?":http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html, the book "Learn Ruby on Rails":http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html, and recommendations for a "Rails tutorial":https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial.

h2. Starter apps

Here are some of the starter apps you can build.

| "rails-devise-pundit":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise-pundit | no tutorial (yet) | authorization with Pundit |

h2. Dependencies

Before running the Rails Composer tool, you need to install:

* The Ruby language (version 2.1)
* Rails (versions 4.1)

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

Be sure to read the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is set up properly.

h4. Rails 4.1

Currently, only Rails 4.1 is supported.

h2. Creating a Starter App

To build a Rails application using the Rails Composer tool:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

Replace @myapp@ with the name of your application.

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

See the "Troubleshooting" section below if you see errors. In general, you'll avoid many problems if you create your application using RVM as described below.

h2. Creating a Starter App Using RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to manage your Rails versions, as described in the "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html article.

Here's how to generate a new Rails application using the Rails Composer tool and RVM:

<pre>
$ mkdir myapp
$ cd myapp
$ rvm use ruby-2.1.1@myapp --ruby-version --create
$ gem install rails
$ rails new . -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

Instead of installing Rails into the global gemset and running @rails new@, we'll create a root directory for a new application, create a new gemset, install Rails, and then generate a starter application.

When we create the gemset, the option "--ruby-version" creates *.ruby-version* and *.ruby-gemset* files in the root directory. RVM recognizes these files in an application's root directory and loads the required version of Ruby and the correct gemset whenever you enter the directory.

When we create the gemset, it will be empty (though it inherits use of all the gems in the global gemset). We immediately install Rails. The command @gem install rails@ installs the most recent stable release of Rails.

Finally we run @rails new .@. We use the Unix "dot" convention to refer to the current directory. This assigns the name of the directory to the new application.

This approach is different from the way most beginners are taught to create a Rails application. Our approach makes it easy to create a project-specific gemset to avoid clashes between gem versions when using the Rails Composer tool.

h2. Choose a RailsApps Starter Application

Use Rails Composer to generate any of the example applications from the "RailsApps project":http://railsapps.github.io/. You'll be able to choose your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you additional options.

To build the example application, Rails must be installed in your development environment.

h4. Rails 4.1

With Rails 4.1, you'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Build a starter application?
      1)  Build a RailsApps example application
      2)  Contributed applications
      3)  Custom application
</pre>

Enter "1" to select *Build a starter application*. You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Starter apps for Rails 4.1. More to come.
      1)  learn-rails
      2)  rails-bootstrap
      3)  rails-foundation
      4)  rails-omniauth
      5)  rails-devise
      6)  rails-devise-pundit
</pre>

Make your choice. The Rails Composer tool may give you other options (other applications may have been added since these notes were written).

h4. Options

The application generator template will ask you for additional preferences. Options vary, depending on the example application you build:

<pre>
 question  Web server for development?
       1)  WEBrick (default)
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
       5)  Phusion Passenger (Apache/Nginx)
       6)  Phusion Passenger (Standalone)
 question  Web server for production?
       1)  Same as development
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
       5)  Phusion Passenger (Apache/Nginx)
       6)  Phusion Passenger (Standalone)
 question  Database used in development?
       1)  SQLite
       2)  PostgreSQL
       3)  MySQL
 question  Template engine?
       1)  ERB
       2)  Haml
       3)  Slim
 question  Test framework?
       1)  None
       2)  RSpec with Capybara
 question  Front-end framework?
       1)  None
       2)  Bootstrap 3.0
       3)  Bootstrap 2.3
       4)  Zurb Foundation 5.0
       5)  Zurb Foundation 4.0
       6)  Simple CSS
   extras  Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders? (y/n)
   extras  Create a GitHub repository? (y/n)
   extras  Use or create a project-specific rvm gemset? (y/n)
</pre>

h4. Web Servers

We recommend Thin in development for speed and less noise in the log files.

If you plan to deploy to Heroku, select Thin as your production webserver. Unicorn is recommended by Heroku but configuration is more complex.

h4. Database

Choose "SQLite" for the easiest setup. If you choose PostgreSQL or MySQL, the databases must be installed and running before you run Rails Composer.

h4. Template Engine

The example applications use the default "ERB" Rails template engine. Optionally, you can use another template engine, such as Haml or Slim. See instructions for "Haml and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-haml.html.

h4. Testing

If you are a beginner, select "None."

h4. Front-end Framework

If you choose a front-end framework, you'll get an application layout file, plus navigation and flash messages, styled with a default theme.

h4. Other Choices

Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders if you want to keep your new site out of Google search results.

If you choose to create a GitHub repository, the generator will prompt you for a GitHub username and password.

It is a good idea to use "RVM":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, and create a project-specific rvm gemset (not available on Windows). See "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html.

h2. Contributed Applications

Currently, there are no contributed applications available for Rails 4.1. If you would like to add your favorite starter application to Rails Composer, open an issue to let me know.

h2. Build Your Own Application

If you choose "I want to build my own application," you will get a wide set of choices. Not all are actively supported.

Rails Composer is primarily a tool to build the RailsApps example applications. I actively maintain the tool to support that mission. A large community of developers contributes code that supports additional gems and favorite configurations offered with the "build your own options." However, not all contributions are actively maintained. That means not all options are tested or fully supported, so you may need to spend time debugging a "build your own application."

When you choose "I want to build my own application," you will see something similar to this:

<pre>

      1)  Build a RailsApps example application
      2)  Build a contributed application
      3)  I want to build my own application

</pre>

h2. Run the Application

Switch to the application directory to examine and test what you've built.

<pre>
$ cd myapp
</pre>

h4. Quick Test

For a "smoke test" to see if everything runs, display a list of Rake tasks.

<pre>
$ rake -T
</pre>

There's no need to run @bundle exec rake@ instead of @rake@ when you are using rvm (see "rvm and bundler integration":https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/).

h4. Start the Web Server

If you've chosen WEBrick or Thin for your web server, can run the app by entering the command:

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

For the Unicorn web server:

@$ unicorn@

See the app at "http://localhost:8080/":http://localhost:8080.

For the Puma web server:

@$ rails server puma@

See the app at "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

For Phusion Passenger (Apache or Nginx integration mode), please refer to "the official documentation":https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation_and_support.

For Phusion Passenger (Standalone):

@$ passenger start@

h4. Login

If you've created a version of the application that sets up a default user, log in with:

* email: user@example.com
* password: changeme

You should delete or change any pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Testing

Some versions of the starter application will contain a suite of RSpec feature and unit tests.

Run @rspec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you want to contribute improved RSpec tests.

h2. Deployment

For easy deployment, use a “platform as a service” provider such as:

* "Heroku":http://www.heroku.com/
* "CloudFoundry":http://www.cloudfoundry.com/
* "EngineYard":http://www.engineyard.com/
* "OpenShift":https://openshift.redhat.com/app/

For deployment on Heroku, see the article:

* "Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Please check both "issues for the Rails Composer tool":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/issues and the "issues for the rails_apps_composer gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues.

You should review the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure you've updated all the components that are required to run Rails successfully.

h4. Problems with "Could not be loaded... You have already activated..."

If you get an error like this:

<pre>
Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
    composer  Running 'after bundler' callbacks.
The template [...] could not be loaded.
Error: You have already activated ..., but your Gemfile requires ....
Using bundle exec may solve this.
</pre>

It's due to conflicting gem versions. See the article "Rails Error: “You have already activated (…)”":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-error-you-have-already-activated.html.

h4. Problems with "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h4. Problems with "Segmentation Fault"

If you get a "segfault" when you try @rails new@, try removing and reinstalling rvm.

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use the Rails Composer application template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use the template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

h2. Documentation and Support

The Rails Composer application template is assembled from recipes supplied by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem. See the rails_apps_composer project to understand how the Rails Composer application works.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to change the template to generate an app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html. A big thanks to Yehuda Katz for "creating Thor":http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/12/by-thors-hammer/.
