h1. Rails Composer

An application template that creates a Rails 3.2 starter app.

It's like the Rails generator on steroids.

The Rails Composer application template is assembled from recipes supplied by the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h2. How to Use

To build a Rails application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

You can use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files or the @-O@ flag to skip Active Record files:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T -O
</pre>

h2. Template Options

The Rails Composer application template will ask you for various preferences.

h2. Application Template Default

The @rails new@ command creates a new Rails application. If you want to use the Rails Composer application template for every Rails application you build, you can set options for the @rails new@ command in a *.railsrc* file in your home directory. Here's how to set up a *.railsrc* file to use the template when you create a new Rails application:

<pre>
# ~/.railsrc
-m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

h2. Troubleshooting

Problems? Check the "issues for the rails_apps_composer gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer/issues.

You should review the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html to make sure you've updated all the components that are required to run Rails successfully.

h4. Problems with  "Certificate Verify Failed"

Are you getting an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" when you try to generate a new Rails app from an application template? See suggestions to resolve the error "Certificate Verify Failed":http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

h4. Customizing the Template

If you wish to change the template to generate an app with your own customized options, you can copy and edit the template file. However, it is better to use the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem to create a new application template. You'll find newer versions of the recipes that make up the application template. You may find issues have been identified and (perhaps) fixed. And it will be easier to maintain your application template if you work from the "rails_apps_composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.
